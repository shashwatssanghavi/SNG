# SNG
Number generator for stochastic representation of given input binary string.
 
 # Process intended
 As per e-book reference,"Stochastic Computing-Techniques and Applications, Warren Gross & Vincent Gaudet, Springer Nature Switzerland AG Publishers, ISBN 978-3-030-03729-1", various approaches are mentioned for generation of a Binary-correspondent Stochastic number representation. This repo will then be extended to accommodate arithmetic operations of the nature in the book.
 The final aim is to implement the VHDL description for a real-time hardware test.
